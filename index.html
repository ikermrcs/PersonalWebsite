            <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
            <p>
              Hi! My name is Iker and I am currently in my final years of Law, Business Administration and Finance, about to begin my professional career. 
              </p>
              <p>Although I had already planned to dedicate myself to the world of investment before, during this time I have been able to learn a lot more and have a clearer idea. My main interest goes beyond traditional investment. What I really like are hedging strategies, riskier assets such as options and futures. Within this interest I also include for me the commodity sector, the Atlas of our economy, led by the "the endless trains of the faithless".
              </p>
              <p>
              As for my qualities I consider these to be some of the main ones in me:
            </p>
            <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
              <li>Critcal. I am able to analyse situations from various perspectives and in an objective manner, which allows me to make better decisions.</li>
              <li>Resolute. I remain calm in any situation, no matter how high the pressure may be, and I seek solutions to problems quickly and decisively.</li>
              <li>Creative. I look for original solutions, facing challenges in unusual ways, and I explore new ideas and approaches.</li>
              <li>Versatile. I adapt easily to any environment or situation, being able to take on different roles, and I have a facility for learning new concepts.s</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In short, I am a person who is always eager to learn something new and grow as a person. I love challenges and facing them in the most creative way, and I always try to leave a positive footprint and contribute positively to my environment.</p>
            <p>I look forward to the challenges this journey will present, and I think the most exciting thing about it is the chance to contribute a verse to this powerful play!</p>

During these years I was a member of the school's football team, I participated in numerous competitions such as the maths olympiads or writing competitions, and I also studied, in a complementary manner, professional music studies. In this same school I studied my baccalaureate in social sciences, beginning my preparation to access the double degree of Business Administration and Law.</p>
